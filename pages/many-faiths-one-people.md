### **GALLERY THREE: Many Faiths One People**
![Gallery 3 overview]({{"/pages/images/G3 main pic.JPG" | absolute_url }})

Singapore's common spaces - places where people of different races and faiths interact and create shared experiences - are a central building block of religious peace and harmony. Here, diverse places of worship coexist peacefully and positive interfaith interactions are not uncommon. However, our high-density urban environment invariably creates friction. This gallery takes a look at some of our common spaces and considers what the state, the community and the individual can do to protect them.
